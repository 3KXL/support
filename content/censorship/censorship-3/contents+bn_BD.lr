description:

If you can't download Tor through our <mark><a href="https://www.torproject.org">website</a></mark>, you can get a copy of Tor delivered to you via GetTor.
GetTor is a service that automatically responds to messages with links to the latest version of Tor Browser, hosted at a variety of locations that are less likely to be censored, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and Github.
