title: How do I download Tor if the torproject.org is blocked?
---
description:

<p class="mb-3">If you can't download Tor through our â€‹<mark><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org\">website</a></mark>, you can get a copy of Tor delivered to you via GetTor. GetTor is a service that automatically responds to messages with links to the latest version of Tor Browser, hosted at a variety of locations that are less likely to be censored, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and Github.</p>
