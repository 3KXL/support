             Tor Browser can certainly help people access your website in places where it is blocked. Most of the time, simply downloading the ​Tor Browser and then using it to navigate to the blocked site will allow access. In places where there is heavy censorship, we have a number of censorship circumvention options available, including ​pluggable transports.

	      That is normal Tor behavior. The first relay in your circuit is called an "entry guard" or "guard.” It is a fast and stable relay that remains the first one in your circuit for 2-3 months in order to protect against a known anonymity-breaking attack. The rest of your circuit changes with every new website you visit, and all together these relays provide the full privacy protections of Tor. For more information on how guard relays work, see this <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters">blog post</a> and <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~hoppernj/single_guard.pdf">paper</a> on entry guards.

	    Sorry to hear that you can't visit the website you wanted! Sometimes websites will block Tor users because they can't tell the difference between the average Tor user and automated traffic. The best success we've had in getting sites to unblock Tor users is getting users to contact the site administrators directly. Something like this might do the trick:
	    "Hi! I tried to access your site xyz.com while using Tor Browser and discovered that you don't allow Tor users to access your site. I urge you to reconsider this decision; Tor is used by people all over the world to protect their privacy and fight censorship. By blocking Tor users, you are likely blocking people in repressive countries who want to use a free internet, journalists and researchers who want to protect themselves from discovery, whistleblowers, activists, and ordinary people who want to opt out of invasive third party tracking. Please take a strong stance in favor of digital privacy and internet freedom, and allow Tor users access to xyz.com. Thank you."
In the case of banks, and other sensitive websites, it is also common to see geography-based blocking (if a bank knows you generally access their services from one country, and suddenly you are connecting from an exit relay on the other side of the world, your account may be locked or suspended).
If you are unable to connect to an onion service, please see [#IcannotreachX.onion I cannot reach X.onion!]

If you can't find it in either of those folders, download it again and look for the prompt that asks you to choose a directory to download it in.

You get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit nodes can compromise your anonymity. If the outcome you want is simply to be able to access resources that are only available in one country, you may want to consider using a VPN instead of using Tor. Please note that VPNs do not have the same privacy properties as Tor, but they will help solve some geolocation restriction issues.

	      Some bridges are built in to Tor Browser, and you can use those bridges by choosing "configure" (then following the prompts) in the Tor Launcher window that pops up when you open Tor Browser for the first time. If you need other bridges, you can get them at our ​<a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/">Bridges website</a>. For more information about bridges, see the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/en-US/bridges.html">​Tor Browser manual</a>.

	      One of the most common issues that causes connection errors in Tor Browser is an incorrect system clock. Please make sure your system clock and timezone are set accurately. If this doesn't fix the problem, see the ​Troubleshooting page on the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/en-US/bridges.html">​Tor Browser manual</a>.

	      Using Tor Browser can sometimes be slower than other browsers. The Tor network has over a million daily users, and just over 6000 relays to route all of their traffic, and the load on each server can sometimes cause latency. You can help improve the speed of the network by running your own relay, or encouraging others to do so. That said, Tor is much faster than it used to be and you may not actually notice any change in speed from other browsers.
