<p class="mb-3">Tor Browser can certainly help people access your website in places where it is blocked. Most of the time, simply downloading the ​Tor Browser and then using it to navigate to the blocked site will allow access. In places where there is heavy censorship, we have a number of censorship circumvention options available, including ​pluggable transports. For more information, please see the ​Tor Browser User Manual section on censorship.</p>
