description:
Many exit nodes are configured to block certain types of file sharing traffic, such as BitTorrent.
BitTorrent in particular is [not anonymous over Tor](https://blog.torproject.org/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea).

For sharing files over Tor, [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/) is a good option.
