The [Deep web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web) makes up most of the internet. What we commonly call the Web is really just the surface.
Beneath that is a vast, mostly [uncharted ocean](https://money.cnn.com/infographic/technology/what-is-the-deep-web/?iid=EL) called the Deep Web.

Tor is valuable as a tool to protect the userâ€™s privacy, but that is not its only function.
The other, more infamous use for Tor is as a gateway into the Deep Web, the massive portion of the Web that is not indexed by search engines. The "Deep web" is merely all the information that cannot be easily accessed through a Web search, which is a lot of data, actually.
