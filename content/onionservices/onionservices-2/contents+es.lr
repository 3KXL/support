<p class="mb-3">
Onion services allow people to browsebut also to publish anonymously, including publishing anonymous websites. Onion services are also relied on for metadata-free chat and file sharing, safer interaction between journalists and their sources like with SecureDrop or OnionShare, safer software updates, and more secure ways to reach popular websites like Facebook.</p>
<p class="mb-3">
These services use the special-use tld .onion (instead of .com,.net,.org,etc..) and are only accessible through the Tor network.</p>
