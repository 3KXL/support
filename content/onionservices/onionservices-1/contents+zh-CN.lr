description:
Websites that are only accessible over Tor are called "onions" and end in the TLD .onion.
For example, the DuckDuckGo onion is <a href="http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion">https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion</a>.
您可以用Tor浏览器访问这些网站。
The addresses must be shared with you by the website host, as onions are not indexed in search engines in the typical way that vanilla websites are.
