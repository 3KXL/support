title: What programs can I use with Tor?
---
description:

There are plenty of other programs you can use with Tor, but we haven't researched the application-level anonymity issues on all of them well enough to be able to recommend a safe configuration. Our wiki has a community-maintained list of instructions for [Torifying specific applications](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO). Please add to these lists and help us keep them accurate! 

Most people use Tor Browser, which includes everything you need to browse the web safely using Tor. Using Tor with other browsers is [dangerous and not recommended](/tbb/tbb-9/).
