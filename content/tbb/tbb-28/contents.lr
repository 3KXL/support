Removing Tor Browser from your system is simple:

On Windows:
* Locate your Tor Browser folder or application. The default location is the Desktop.
* Delete the Tor Browser folder or application.
* Empty your Trash.

On macOS:
* Locate your Tor Browser application. The default location is the Applications folder.
* Move the Tor Browser application to Trash.
* Go to your `~/Library/Application Support/` folder.
* Note the Library folder is hidden on newer versions of macOS. To navigate to this folder in Finder, select "Go to Folder..." in the "Go" menu.

On Linux:
* Locate your Tor Browser folder. On Linux, there is no default location, however the folder will be named "tor-browser_en-US" if you are running the English Tor Browser.
* Delete the Tor Browser folder.
* Empty your Trash.

Note that your operating systemâ€™s standard "Uninstall" utility is not used.
