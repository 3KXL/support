title: Why did my search engine switch to DuckDuckGo?
---
description: 
<p class="mb-3">With the release of Tor Browser 6.0.6, we switched to DuckDuckGo as the primary search engine. For a while now, Disconnect has had no access to Google search results which we used in Tor Browser. Disconnect being more of a meta search engine which allows users to choose between different search providers fell back to delivering Bing search results which were basically unacceptable quality-wise.</p>
