description:
It's strongly discouraged to install new add-ons in Tor Browser, because they can compromise your privacy and security.
Tor Browser already comes installed with two add-ons — <mark><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a></mark> and <mark><a href="https://noscript.net/">NoScript</a></mark> — and adding anything else could deanonymize you.
