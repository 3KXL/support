description:
Running Tor Browser does not make you act as a relay in the network.
This means that your computer will not be used to route traffic for others.
If you'd like to become a relay, please see our <mark><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide">Tor Relay Guide</a></mark>.
