seo_slug: Tor Browser 提示 Firefox 无响应

description:
Tor Browser is built using <mark><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/">Firefox ESR</a></mark>, so errors regarding Firefox may occur.
Please be sure no other instance of Tor Browser is already running, and that you have extracted Tor Browser in a location that your user has the correct permissions for.
If you are running an anti-virus, please see <mark><a href="http://support.torproject.org/#tbb-10">My antivirus/malware protection is blocking me from accessing Tor Browser</a></mark>, it is common for anti-virus / anti-malware software to cause this type of issue.
