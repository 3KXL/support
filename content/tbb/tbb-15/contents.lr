description: 
Unfortunately, we don't yet have a version of Tor Browser for Chrome OS. 
However, you can run [Tor Browser for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser) on Chrome OS. Note that by using Tor Mobile on Chrome OS, you will view the mobile (not desktop) versions of websites.
