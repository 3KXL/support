description:
Flash is disabled in Tor Browser, and we recommend you do not enable it.
We don’t think Flash is safe to use in any browser — it's a very insecure piece of software that can easily compromise your privacy or serve you malware.
Fortunately, most websites, devices, and other browsers are moving away from the use of Flash.
