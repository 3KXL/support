目前没有支持设置Tor浏览器为默认浏览器的方法。
The Tor Browser works hard to isolate itself from the rest of your system, and the steps for making it the default browser are unreliable.
This means sometimes a website would load in the Tor Browser, and sometimes it would load in another browser, this type of behavior can be dangerous and anonymity-breaking.
