description:
Tor Browser can certainly help people access your website in places where it is blocked.
Most of the time, simply downloading the <mark><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a></mark> and then using it to navigate to the blocked site will allow access.
In places where there is heavy censorship we have a number of censorship circumvention options available, including <mark><a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/en-US/transports/">pluggable transports</a></mark>.

For more information, please see the <mark><a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/en-US/">Tor Browser User Manual</a></mark> section on <mark><a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/en-US/circumvention.html">censorship</a></mark>.
