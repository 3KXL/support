title: Why I can't join Tor-dev and other channels?
---
description:

The #tor-project channel is where Tor people discuss and coordinate daily Tor work. It has fewer members than #tor and is more focused on the work at hand. You are also welcome to join this channel. To access #tor-project, your nickname (nick) must be registered and verified.

Here's how to reach #tor-project and other registered channels. This can be tricky; bring your patience and a cup of your favorite beverage.

### Register your nickname

1. Log onto #tor. See [How can I chat with Tor Project teams?](FIXME)

2. Then, click on the word "Status" at the top left of the screen. 

3. In the window at the bottom of the page, type:  `/msg nickserv REGISTER yournewpassowrd youremailaddress`

4. Hit enter.

If all goes well, you will receive a message that you are registered. 

The system may register you as your nick_ instead of your nick.

If so, just go with it but remember you are user_ and not user.

Every time you log on to IRC, to identify your registered nick, type: 

`/nick yournick`

`/msg nickserv IDENTIFY YourPassWord`

### To verify your nickname

Then, to complete the registration and ultimately gain access to the #tor-project channel, your nickname must be **VERIFIED**.

1. To verify your nick, open a new browser window and go to â€‹https://services.oftc.net/. 

2. Log in with your IRC nickname and password. 

3. Look for the word VERIFIED and log in there. It may appear that nothing has happened. Look at the top of the page, and there will be a column called ACCOUNT. 

4. Click on ACCOUNT. 

5. Click on the small sentence at the bottom of the square that says: Verify account. 

6. Fill out the CAPTCHA that pops up, and click ok. 

7. A tiny message will appear: "Your NickServ account has been verified."

8. Go back to the IRC webpage where you are logged in and type: 
`/msg nickserv checkverify`

9. Click ENTER

10. If all is well, you will receive a message that says: 

```
*!NickServ*checkverify

Usermodechange: +R

!NickServ- Successfully set +R on your nick.

Your nick is verified! Hurrah!
```

Now, to join #tor-project, you can just type: 

`/join #tor-project` and hit enter.

You will be allowed into the channel. If so, Congratulations!

However, if you get stuck, you can ask for help in the #tor channel. You can toggle back and forth between channels by clicking on the different channel names at the top left of the IRC window.
