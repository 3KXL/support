<p class="mb-3">We are so sorry, but you have been infected with malware. The Tor Project did not create this malware. The malware authors are asking you to download Tor Browser presumably to contact them anonymously with the ransom they're demanding from you. If this is your first introduction to Tor Browser, we understand that you might think we're bad people who enable even worse people. But please consider that our software is used every day for a wide variety of purposes by ​human rights activists, journalists, domestic violence survivors, whistleblowers, law enforcement officers, and many others. Unfortunately, the protection that our software can provide to these groups of people can also be abused by criminals and malware authors. The Tor Project does not support or condone the use of our software for malicious purposes.</p>

title: Why don't you prevent bad people from doing bad things when using Tor?
---
seo_slug: prevent-bad-people-doing-bad-things-with-tor
---
description: 
<p class="mb-3">Tor is designed to defend human rights and privacy by preventing anyone from censoring things, even us. We hate that there are some people who use Tor to do terrible things, but we can't do anything to get rid of them without also undermining the human rights activists, journalists, abuse survivors, and other people who use Tor for good things. If we wanted to block certain people from using Tor, we'd basically be adding a backdoor to the software, which would open up our vulnerable users to attacks from bad regimes and other adversaries.</p>

description: 
<p class="mb-3">There is nothing the Tor developers can do to trace Tor users. The same protections that keep bad people from breaking Tor's anonymity also prevent us from tracking users.</p>

seo_slug: change-the-number-of-hops-tor-uses

description: 
<p class="mb-3">Right now the path length is hard-coded at 3 plus the number of nodes in your path that are sensitive. That is, in normal cases it's 3, but for example if you're accessing an onion service or a ".exit" address it could be more.</p>
<p class="mb-3">We don't want to encourage people to use paths longer than this as it increases load on the network without (as far as we can tell) providing any more security. Also, using paths longer than 3 could harm anonymity, first because it makes<mark><a href="https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs07-doa">denial of security</a></mark> ttacks easier, and second because it could act as an identifier if only a small number of users have the same path length as you.</p>
