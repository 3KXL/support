Onion services allow people to browsebut also to publish anonymously, including publishing anonymous websites. Onion services are also relied on for metadata-free chat and file sharing, safer interaction between journalists and their sources like with SecureDrop or OnionShare, safer software updates, and more secure ways to reach popular websites like Facebook.</p>
<p class="mb-3">
These services use the special-use tld .onion (instead of .com,.net,.org,etc..) and are only accessible through the Tor network.</p>

<p class="mb-3">If you cannot reach the onion service you desire, make sure that you have entered the 16-character onion address correctly: even a small mistake will stop Tor Browser from being able to reach the site. If you are still unable to connect to the onion service, please try again later. There may be a temporary connection issue, or the site operators may have allowed it to go offline without warning.</p><p class="mb-3">You can also ensure that you're able to access other onion services by connecting to <a href="http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion">DuckDuckGo's ​onion service</a>.</p>

<p class="mb-3">Websites that are only accessible over Tor are called "onions" and end in the TLD .onion. For example, the DuckDuckGo onion is ​<a href="http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion">https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion</a>. You can access these websites by using Tor Browser. The addresses must be shared with you by the website host, as onions are not indexed in search engines in the typical way that vanilla websites are.</p>
